Guides for running anything on a Pixel Watch 3 but Wear OS/Android 15.

## A few notes

> [!NOTE]
> Welcome! First, Why on hell are you here. Alright ok i'll show you the way below.
> Just do not do this. There's no point and expect no benefit lol.

> This has only been tested on Luna (Pixel Watch 3 Large size, with LTE). Compatibility with Selene (Pixel Watch 3 small size, with LTE), Helios and Sol (Pixel Watch 3 WiFi/BT Only models) is only expected.

First of all:

1) Why you want to do this
2) you came to the right place anyway

When the question "Why?" has simply no answer.

Except this one:

- Watches use modern technology (ARM 64 Bit processors, even quad core)
- Watches have enough ram (2GB of DDR3 RAM)
- Watches have storage (32GB of eMMC storage)
- Watches have all the connectivity youll ever need to go on social media (WLAN, BT, Cellular even)
- Watches have enough battery
- Watches have even SD Card support (seriously, your wlan/bt is wired up using SDIO, in 2024, unbelievable, straight up from PDA days)
- Watches are on your wrist
- Watches are ✨ round ✨ (a statement of modernity some say)
- Watches are cool
- Watches.
- Ok I only wanted to do it on a watch because it would be goofy and silly.
